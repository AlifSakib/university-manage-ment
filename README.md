###### Project Setup

-> npm init - y (creates package.json file) "main": "src/server.ts" (in package.json file) (this is the entry point of the application) (this is the file which will be executed when we run the application)

-> yarn add -D typescript (installs typescript as dev dependency) because we are using typescript for the development purpose only not for the production purpose. in production we use javascript.

-> yarn add mongoose express (installs mongoose and express as dependencies)

-> tsc --init (creates tsconfig.json file) (this file contains the configuration for the typescript compiler)

-> yarn add dotenv (installs dotenv as dependency) (dotenv is used to load environment variables from a .env file into process.env)

-> connect to mongoose

-> create espress server

-> yarn add -D @types/express

-> yarn add ts-node-dev --dev (installs ts-node-dev as dev dependency) (ts-node-dev is used to run the typescript files directly without compiling them to javascript files)

-> yard add cors (installs cors as dependency) (cors is used to allow cross origin requests)
